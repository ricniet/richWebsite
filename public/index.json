In conjunction with Drs. Jodi Casiabianca (Educational Testing Services, previously UT-Austin) and Brian Junker (Carnegie Mellon), this work has focused on developing theory, generating code for fitting Bayesian models, empirically testing these methods via Monte Carlo simulations, and disseminating the work through research articles and conference workshops. Keep reading to learn a bit more about the HRM, and the work I\u0026rsquo;m completing as part of my dissertation.\nHierarchical Rater Models Ratings are ubiquitous in psychological measurement\u0026mdash;performance appraisals in the industry might rely on ratings collected from supervisors, therapists complete observational inventories to measure psychological traits, and essays from standardized tests are scored by raters trained on rating rubrics, just to name a few. From a measurement perspective, ratings are fundamentally flawed because they rely on subjective judgement. Idiosyncratic rater behavior introduces a form of measurement error, collectively called rater effects, that erodes the integrity of the final scores used to describe the subject of those ratings. This is clearly problematic, given that assessments are designed to be fair, and final scores are often tied to high-stakes decisions. In the examples above, ratings might be tied to loss of employment, misdiagnosis, and failing scores. The HRM framework was developed as a way to simultaneously describe individual rater behavior and provide measurement of individuals\u0026rsquo; psychological traits while correcting for rater effects. Besides providing more accurate and reliable measurement, by summarizing rater behavior via model parameters, it encourages ongoing assessment of raters\u0026rsquo; performance, which can be used to inform future rater trainings.\nThe HRM is a latent variable model composed of two separate modeling stages, which highlights the hierarchical structure of the rating process. The first stage is a signal detection model for observed ratings that produces as its output a measure of rater severity/leniency error, rater variability, as well as an ideal score (the score the individual would have received from a perfect rater with no bias). The second stage is an item response theory (IRT) model, which takes these ideal ratings (corrected for rater effects), and produces estimates of the latent trait of interest (e.g., depression, writing procifiency).\nExtensions of this basic model have been made to accomodate multidimensional structure in rating instruments, time series and longitudinal ratings, and inclusion of covariates of the rating process.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in more on the mechanics of the HRM, stay tuned for upcoming tutorials.\nMy Research My work on the HRM includes the development of the HRM for multidimensional rating rubrics (paper just submitted!), as well as the evaluation of the HRM for rater covariates (my dissertation).\n","date":1461733200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461733200,"objectID":"840a5607cf0c6809be660526d6934c31","permalink":"/project/research/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/research/","section":"project","summary":"Dissertation Research","tags":["Research","Psychometrics","Measurement"],"title":"Research","type":"project"},{"authors":["GA Cushen"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1441083600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441083600,"objectID":"d77fa4a74076ffcd7ca6c21cfc27a4b2","permalink":"/publication/person-re-id/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/person-re-id/","section":"publication","summary":"Person re-identification is a critical security task for recognizing a person across spatially disjoint sensors. Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["GA Cushen","MS Nixon"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372654800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372654800,"objectID":"2b4d919e3cf73dfcd0063c88fe01cb00","permalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/clothing-search/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications. Evaluated on a challenging dataset, the system is relatively fast and achieves promising results.","tags":[],"title":"Mobile visual clothing search","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
