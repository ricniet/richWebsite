      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent considerable time developing JAGS/Stan code for fitting Bayesian IRT models. Understanding (let alone resolving) identification constraints has to be one of the most frustrating stages in the workflow. I think this is largely because constraints are already configured in the software we use to implement these models, so there&amp;rsquo;s just little reason to know the details! For those of us who work within a Bayesian framework, however, when it comes time to identify our model, it&amp;rsquo;s an inevitable trip to Google, and/or trial-and-error until we hope that our solutions worked.</description>
